If we write $A=U\\Sigma V^{\\mathsf{T}}$, and then note that $U$ and $V^{\\mathsf{T}}$ are both change of basis matrices, we deduce that only $\\Sigma$ is doing any scaling. But $\\Sigma$ is an ``almost diagonal'' matrix, and hence it scales based on its non-zero entries only. Remember that (by convention!)~all the entries on the main diagonal of $\\Sigma$ are non-negative. Hence the largest such value represents the biggest scaling factor, which is the right-hand side of the identity."
