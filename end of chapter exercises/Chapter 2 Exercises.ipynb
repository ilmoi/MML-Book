    "## Question 1\n",
    "### Part a\n",
    "We have to check the five properties listed in Definition 2.7. Firstly, let's look at closure. Our operation should take two elements of $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{-1\\}$, and spit out a real number which isn't $-1$. Clearly we will get a real answer, so let's suppose we can get $-1$, and we'll hopefully find a contradiction. Let $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{-1\\}$ be such that $-1 = ab + a+ b$. Then $ab+a+b+1 = 0$, so $(a+1)(b+1) = 0$. Therefore, either $a=-1$ or $b=-1$, which is a contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we attack associativity. We use the fact that $+$ is associative and commutative on $\\mathbb{R}$. We have\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "(a\\star b) \\star c & = (ab+a+b) \\star c \\\\\n",
    "& = (ab+a+b)c + (ab+a+b) + c \\\\\n",
    "& = abc + ac + bc + ab + a + b + c \\\\\n",
    "& = abc + ab + ac + a + bc + b + c \\\\\n",
    "& = a(bc+b+c) + a + (bc+b+c) \\\\\n",
    "& = a(b\\star c)+a + (b\\star c) \\\\\n",
    "& = a\\star (b\\star c).\n",
    "\\end{align*}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that $a\\star 0 = a \\cdot 0 +a+0 = a$, and similarly $0\\star a = a$, so $0$ is the neutral element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourthly, we take $x \\star y = 0$ (the neutral element we found in the previous step). Solving for $y$ in terms of $x$, we find that $ y = \\frac{-x}{x+1}, $ which always exists, since $x\\neq -1$. Thus such a $y$ is the inverse element for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{-1\\}$. This concludes the argument that $(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{-1\\},\\star)$ is a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if we observe that $a\\star b = b \\star a$, by the commutativity of multiplication and addition of real numbers, then we can conclude that $(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{-1\\},\\star)$ is an $abelian$ group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part b\n",
    "Let's compute the left hand side as $3\\star (x \\star x)$, say. We have $3 \\star (x^2+2x)$, and thus $3(x^2+2x)+(x^2+2x)+3 = 15$. From this, we obtain $4x^2+8x-12 = 0$, so $x=1$ or $x=-3$.  You can check that both of these do indeed work in the original equation.\n",

    "## Question 2\n",
    "### Part a\n",
    "The major thing we need to check here is whether the operation $\\oplus$ is well-defined. That is to say, if we take two different representatives of the same congruence classes, do we definitely get the same answer at the end? Let's take $a_1, a_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} $ such that $\\overline{a_1} = \\overline{a_2}$, and similarly let $b_1, b_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} $ such that $\\overline{b_1} = \\overline{b_2}$. We need to show that $\\overline{a_1}\\oplus \\overline{b_1} = \\overline{a_2} \\oplus \\overline{b_2}$. In other words, we need to show that $\\overline{a_1+b_1} = \\overline{a_2+b_2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the definition of the congruence class, two classes $\\overline{a_1}$ and $\\overline{a_2}$ are equal in $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ if and only if $a_1 - a_2$ is a multiple of $n$. Let's say $a_1 - a_2 = k_1 n$ and ${b_1 - b_2 = k_2 n}$, for some $k_1, k_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Observe then that $(a_1+b_1)-(a_2+b_2) = (k_1+k_2)n$, and so $\\overline{a_1+b_1} = \\overline{a_2+b_2}$ indeed!\n",

    "If $n$ is prime, then every integer from $1$ to $n-1$ will be relatively prime to $n$. Let $a$ be such an integer. Then, by B\\'ezout's theorem, there exist integers $u, v$ such that $au+nv=1$. If we take this identity mod $n$, we have $\\overline{au} \\oplus \\overline{nv} = \\overline{1}$. But $nv$ is a multiple of $n$, so $\\overline{nv} = \\overline{0}$, and this simplifies to $\\overline{a} \\otimes \\overline{u} = \\overline{1}$ -- in other words, $\\overline{u}$ is the inverse of $\\overline{a}$. Also, if we take two integers $a$ and $b$, both of which are relatively prime to $n$, then the product $ab$ also cannot contain a factor of $n$, since $n$ is prime, so the operation is closed. The other properties follow immediately. This shows that we have a group. $\\lozenge$\n",

Subtracting these equations, we have $0=\\alpha_1v_1 + \\alpha_2v_2 -\\alpha_4v_4 - \\alpha_5v_5$. Remember we want a non-zero solution for $v$, and observe that the rank of $\\left[v_1|v_2|v_4\\right]$ is 3 (i.e.~these three vectors are linearly independent). Hence we can take $\\alpha_5=9$, say (this means we don't have fractions later, but there's no way to know this a priori!), and solve for the other $\\alpha_i$'s.
